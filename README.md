# AppLogin

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p> This project is about applying a new concept in OOP: <strong>delegate</strong> in Swift.</p>
<p>The app consists in a simple screen where user can Sign Up or Sign In. Depending on which button is selected, user's credentials, like email and password, will be checked to make sure he/she hasn't been registered before or if the credentials informed are valid or not.</p>

<p>Before any email is informed, both buttons are gray, showing they are disabled and the user should give its credentials.</p>

<p>Once the email is informed, both buttons become ready to do what they are saying: Sign In and Sign Up. This is easily seen by their change of color.</p>

<p>Alerts and background colors were used to inform the user if the Sign Up or Sign In process was successful or not. For example, red background color were used to inform if the password doesn't match to which one was registered for the first time the user signed up, or if that email hasn't been registered yet. Green background color and blue background color were used to inform the user that sign in and sign up process has been successful, respectively.</p>

<p>Again, even though it's a simple sample of code, none real user is registered in a database, only in an array inside my code, it's a great opportunity to demonstrate how to use storyboard, functions, variables, classes, etc., in Swift.</p>
